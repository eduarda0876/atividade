Tears of the feeble
Hands of the slaves
Skin of the mothers
Mouths of the babes
Building the towers
Belongs to the sky
When the whole thing comes crashing down
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
Under the shelf
The shelf of the sky
Two eyes, two suns
Too heavenly blinds
Swallowing rivers
Belongs to the sea
When the whole thing washes away
Don't run to me
I'll be going down
For the rest of the slide
While the rest of you harvest the gold
And the wreck of you
Is the death of you all
And the wreck of you is the break and the fall
I'm the wreck of you
I'm the death of you all
I'm the wreck of you
I'm the break and the fall
Under the red break of the lights
Heroes in the stretches
Inch to the site
Blowing the pieces
Belong to the wind
When the whole thing blows away
I won't pretend, no
I'll be going down
For the rest of the ride
While the rest of you harvest the souls
And the wreck of you
Is the death of you all
And the wreck of you
Is the break and the fall
I'm the wreck of you
I'm the death of you all
I'm the wreck of you
I'm the break and the fall
Under the red under the lights
Lies the wreck of you for the rest of your life
And the wreck of you
Is the death of you all
And the wreck of you
Is the break and the fall
I'm the wreck of you
I'm the death of you all
I'm the wreck of you
I'm the break and the fall
While the rest of you harvest the gold
While the rest of you harvest the souls
