Mufasa, hmm?
You know we finally here, right?
Where are we?

It's Friday then
Then Saturday, Sunday, what?

(Their lives, to pull us) then Saturday, Sunday, what?
(Learn, their lives again) it's Friday

It's Friday again, -gain, -ain, -ain

I thought the hands of time would change me
And I'd be over this by now, yeah
It's been too long since we got crazy
I'm lowkey spinnin' out

I'm countin' down till Friday come
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do too much
Know I'm all in my bag, that's clutch
Feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it
Every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Endless weekend, on a wave, yeah

It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
(We want that weekend)
It's Friday again (oh)
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
(We want that weekend)
It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?

(Their lives again)
(Their lives, to pull us)
(Their lives again)

This can't be bad for me, 'cause I want more
Wanna feel the bass vibrating through the floor
So keep it playing, I'm on a wave
And I'ma ride it all the way
When it comes like

We want that weekend (again, -gain, -gain, again)
(-Gain, again, -gain, -gain)
Weekend, -kend (again, -gain, -gain, again, -gain, oh)
We want that weekend (again, -gain, -gain, again)
